        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Four years ago, I embarked on a journey to transition from Explosive Ordnance Disposal to the dynamic world of technology. While working full-time in Iraq, I am simultaneously pursuing my Bachelor's degree at Harvard Extension School. This institution provides me with a high-quality education, thanks to its exceptional instructors and diverse cohort of classmates. <br> <br>

I opted for the Computer Science (CS) program at Harvard Extension School because it allows students to follow the same academic semester roadmap as those at Harvard College. Having access to the same courses as Harvard College students is an invaluable opportunity that enriches my learning experience.
