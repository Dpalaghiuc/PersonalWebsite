                            <h2>Experience</h2>
                            <p>As a technical professional with over 14 years of experience in Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operations, I specialize in Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), and Homemade Explosives (HME). Throughout my career, I have conducted classroom presentations related to basic explosive ordnance and decontamination awareness.<br>

                              <br> My experience includes 11 years overseas with 4.5 years in Afghanistan as an Unexploded Ordnance Disposal Technician (UXO Technician II) and 7 years in Iraq as EOD Technician for the Department of State. During my time in Afghanistan, I successfully developed and implemented plans to account for and safely dispose of unserviceable explosive ordnance. In Iraq, I conducted post-blast analysis training to Iraqi Army EOD and Iraqi Police Bomb Squad departments.<br>

                              <br> I have a proven track record of leadership and team building, as well as expertise in complex WMD and IED operations, policy and program development, and strategic planning and execution. Additionally, I am well-versed in regulatory compliance, chemical weapons training, biological threat reduction, and nonproliferation prevention.<br>

                              <br>Let's connect to discuss how I can help your organization with its explosive ordnance disposal and safety needs.</p>
